This page is dedicated to *testnets*. We distinguish between our
**public testnet** that has been deployed and is fully functional for
anyone to use and is shared among developers, and **private testnets**
that every developer could easily deploy at home to benefit from
extra low latency and additional super powers over the network.

You can find all the relevant information about the public network on a
dedicated page:

.. centered:: `Open Public Testnet <http://testnet.bitshares.eu>`_
              (:doc:`technical details <public-testnet>`)

Tutorials about how to deploy a public, or a private network are
presented in separated tutorials:
