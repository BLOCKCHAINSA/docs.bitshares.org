BitShares 2.0: General Overview
################################################

**Abstract**: BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized platform built
for high-performance financial smart contracts. The decentralized exchange that
allows for trading of arbitrary pairs without counterparty risk facilitates
only one out of many available features. Market-pegged assets, such as the
bitUSD, are crypto tokens that come with all the advantages of traditional
cryptocurrencies like bitcoin but trade for at least the value of their
underlying asset, e.g. $1. Furthermore, BitShares represents the first
decentralized autonomous company that lets its shareholders decide on its
future direction and products. This paper gives a brief overview over the whole
BitShares platform, recapitulates known blockchain technologies and redefines
state-of-the-art.

BitShares 2.0: Financial Smart Contract Platform
################################################

**Abstract**: Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto released his whitepaper and
corresponding software for bitcoin, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has continued
to grow at a rapid pace. In the beginning, Bitcoin created a platform that
anyone could use to transfer value across the internet without middlemen, banks
or counterparty risk. However, once bitcoin's basic blockchain consensus
technology became established and stable, people began to discuss whether
blockchain technology could also be applied to enable the trade of multiple
assets without the need for a broker or centralized clearinghouse. BitShares
has created such a technology, and has coined the term "decentralized exchange"
(DEX) to describe our Bitcoin 2.0 platform. Currently, it supports trade not
only in digital assets, but also traditional financial instruments and
securities on the blockchain. The two main tools we provide for the creation of
these instruments, market pegged assets (MPA) and user-issued assets (UIA), are
discussed in detail in this paper.

BitShares 2.0: Stress-Test Results
##################################

**Abstract**: BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized
platform built for high-performance financial smart contracts. In order
to show its capabilities in the field, we have conducted a stress test
on the public testnet. The testnet has been deployed with the same code
base that is used for the BitShares network and has nodes around the
globe. Only margin changes have been made to distinguish the testnet
from the productive network, properly. A multi-phase stress-test has
been proposed and accepted that modifies the maximum transaction size,
maximum block size and block confirmation times in the live network
during the stress test. Validators have been kept up to date by means of
stake-weighted voting.
