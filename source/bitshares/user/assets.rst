*************
Assets/Tokens
*************

The BitShares 2.0 network consist of several *assets*, *tokens* or *currencies*.
All assets are equal from a technological point of view and come with more or
less the same features, namely, they can be traded against each other and can be
transfered within seconds. The differences between them are of economical
nature.

**Market-Pegged Assets (MPA)**

These *SmartCoins* track the value of an underlaying asset, such as Gold, or
U.S. Dollar. Smartcoins can be created by anyone contracting with the
BitShares ecosystem and putting sufficient BTS (at least 175%) into the so
called contract for difference as *collateral*.

**Exchange Backed Assets (EBA)**

This kind of asset is commonly known as *I owe you* (IOU). It represents
the right to withdraw the *same amount* (minus fees) of a backing asset
from a *central* entity. Often they are issued by a bank, an exchange or
an other financial institute to represent deposit receipts.

**Prediction Market Asset**


A prediction market is similar to a MPA, that trades between 0 and 1,
only. After an event, a price feed can be used to determine which option
to take and participants can settle at this price.
