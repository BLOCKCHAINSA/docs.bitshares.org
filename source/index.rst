Welcome to the Graphene Documentation
=========================================

Below, you can find the Graphene documentation. Since BitShares 2.0 is the
first application of the Graphene technology, you will be able to use almost
everything in BitShares 2.0, too. We separated the documentation into smaller
parts for convenience ans for the sake of easy location of relevant
information.

:doc:`migration/index`
----------------------

The migration tutorial is relevant only to those customers and investors that
have participated in BitShares 1.0. We show improvements, new features and give
assistance for claiming your funds in BitShares 2.0.
