Sources
=======

The sources are located at [github](http://github.com) and can be downloaded
with `git`.::

    git clone https://github.com/ FIXME

Since the repository makes use of so called *submodules* which are repositories
on their own, we need to refresh those.::

    git submodule update --init --recursive
