"The BitShares 2.0 wallet architecture is vastly different than BitShares "

"of keys, each of which is controlling a small portion of your balance and"
" for TITAN users, none of the balances associated with your account use "
"the same key as your account.  Under BitShares 2.0, all of these "
"\"balances\" become unique accounts rather than a single logical account."
" The BitShares 2.0 wallet has an \"import\" interface that allows you to "
"specify a set of private keys and the name of an account that you would "
"like to receive all of the funds associated with those keys. Then it "
"generates a transaction that spends the full balances from all accounts "
"associated with those keys to your new unified BitShares 2.0 account. The"

"**Additional Privatized BitAssets**: In contrast to Market Pegged Assets "
"(also known as BitAssets) that have a price feed published by witnesses "
"that have approval of shareholders, a *privatized* bitasset allows to "
"create market pegged assets that have an individual set of price feed "
"publishers that do not need shareholders' approval. Hence, everyone can "
"create a privatized bitAsset to track an individual value, such as "
"indices, or binary predictions."
