"BSIP stands for BitShares Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an "
"improvement *protocol*. A BSIP is a design document providing information"
" to the BitShares community, or describing a new feature for BitShares or"
" its processes or environment. The BSIP should provide a concise "
"technical specification of the feature or the idea and a rationale for "
"it. It may not only describe technical improvements but also document "
"*best-practises* and recommendations."

msgid ""
"We intend BSIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, "
"for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the "
"design decisions that have gone into BitShares. The BSIP author is "
"responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting "
"dissenting opinions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developers/bsips.rst:17
msgid ""
"Because the BSIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository,"
" their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal."

"You have a great idea for a business on top of within the BitShares "
"platform and are searching for a way to fund your idea? Here are the "
"options we can offer you:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developers/funding.rst:9
msgid ""
"**Basic Worker Proposal**: All BitShares shareholders can cast a vote for"
" your proposal/idea and will decide if they want this feature or not at "
"the price you are asking. If they accept the price you asked, you will be"
" #paidbyprotocol in BTS. If not, you can of course refine your proposal "
"and try again incorporating feedback received from shareholders and the "
"community."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developers/funding.rst:15
msgid ""
"**Fee Backed Asset**: If you produce a feature for BitShares that offers "
"a new service, you can have a :doc:`../user/fba` created for your feature"
" and profit from future revenue streams generated by that particular "
"feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developers/funding.rst:19
msgid ""
"**Crowdfunding**: Instead of profiting from your FBA, you can sell them "
"to investors to fund the implementation. Or you simply create, issue and "
"sell a :doc:`../user/uia`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developers/funding.rst:22
msgid ""
"**Mixed Funding**: You sell some of the FBA and keep the rest for "
"yourself. Maybe the best option, you get money instantly to fund the "
"development and you will get more later when people use the feature."

msgid ""
"If you want to develop a blockchain/backend feature, you *should* "
"probably cooperate with Cryptonomex as they can consult you how to "
"implement everything on the blockchain and most shareholders will ask "
"them to check the quality of your code prior to its hard fork, anyway."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developers/funding.rst:34
msgid ""
"Other tasks, such as basic GUI development, etc. can mostly be dealt with"
" independently, unless access to the main repository is required. This "
"can be asked from Cryptonomex or other active, but independent, web "
"developers."
