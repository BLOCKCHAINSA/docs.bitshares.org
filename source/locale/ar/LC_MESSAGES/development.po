"In contrast to most cryptocurrency wallets, the BitShares 2.0 has a "
"different model to represent the blockchain, its transactions and "
"accounts. This chapter wants to given an introduction to the concepts of "
"*objects* as they are used by the BitShares 2.0 client. Furthermore, we "
"will briefly introduce the API and show how to subscribe to object "
"changes (such as new blocks or incoming deposits). Afterwards, we will "
"show how exchange may monitor their accounts and credit incoming funds to"
