msgid "BitShares 2.0: General Overview"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/papers/index.rst:11
msgid ""
"**Abstract**: BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized platform"
" built for high-performance financial smart contracts. The decentralized "
"exchange that allows for trading of arbitrary pairs without counterparty "
"risk facilitates only one out of many available features. Market-pegged "
"assets, such as the bitUSD, are crypto tokens that come with all the "
"advantages of traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin but trade for at "
"least the value of their underlying asset, e.g. $1. Furthermore, "
"BitShares represents the first decentralized autonomous company that lets"
" its shareholders decide on its future direction and products. This paper"
" gives a brief overview over the whole BitShares platform, recapitulates "
"known blockchain technologies and redefines state-of-the-art."

"**Abstract**: Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto released his whitepaper and "
"corresponding software for bitcoin, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has "
"continued to grow at a rapid pace. In the beginning, Bitcoin created a "
"platform that anyone could use to transfer value across the internet "
"without middlemen, banks or counterparty risk. However, once bitcoin's "
"basic blockchain consensus technology became established and stable, "
"people began to discuss whether blockchain technology could also be "
"applied to enable the trade of multiple assets without the need for a "
"broker or centralized clearinghouse. BitShares has created such a "
"technology, and has coined the term \"decentralized exchange\" (DEX) to "
"describe our Bitcoin 2.0 platform. Currently, it supports trade not only "
"in digital assets, but also traditional financial instruments and "
"securities on the blockchain. The two main tools we provide for the "
"creation of these instruments, market pegged assets (MPA) and user-issued"
" assets (UIA), are discussed in detail in this paper."

"**Abstract**: BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized platform"
" built for high-performance financial smart contracts. In order to show "
"its capabilities in the field, we have conducted a stress test on the "
"public testnet. The testnet has been deployed with the same code base "
"that is used for the BitShares network and has nodes around the globe. "
"Only margin changes have been made to distinguish the testnet from the "
"productive network, properly. A multi-phase stress-test has been proposed"
" and accepted that modifies the maximum transaction size, maximum block "
"size and block confirmation times in the live network during the stress "
"test. Validators have been kept up to date by means of stake-weighted "
"voting."
