Importing Your Wallet
===================================

BitShares 2.0 has a **Wallet management Console.**. It can be access via
`BitShares 2.0: Settings -> Wallets` and allows to import your wallet in
different ways:

* **Import Wallet**:
  Here you can provide the wallet backup file produced from BitShares 0.9.3c!
  You will be asked to define where to put your individual balances if you have
  multiple accounts.

* **Import Brainkey** (wallet.bitshares.org users only):
  Funds stored in the [web wallet](http://wallet.bitshares.org) can be
  imported by providing the brainkey provided as backup option. It can be
  obtained from the web wallet's preferences.

* **Manual Import**:
  Alternatively, you can import your account names and claim your funds
  manually
