Since BitShares allows everyone to establish their coin or business on
the same blockchain, they can benefit from synergies. Every customer of
a competing business or coin that is part of BitShares already has an
account capable of dealing with your business or holding your coins.
Besides a shared user base, we also have shared markets. You can think
of shared markets like a market that trades BitStampUSD versus
KrakenUSD, both being IOUs for fiat USD at the corresponding platform.
Suddenly, every user of one exchange can be a potential user for a
competing business, not just for the exchange business.
