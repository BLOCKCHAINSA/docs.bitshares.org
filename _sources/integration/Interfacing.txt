Interfacing with the BitShares Ecosystem
=========================================

To interface your existing platform with BitShares, you can make use of
:doc:`../api/rpc` and :doc:`../api/websocket` to either a :doc:`full node
<../apps/Witness>` (for monitoring only) or the :doc:`CLI wallet
<../apps/CliWallet>` (for accessing funds). Instead of running the P2P full
node and the CLI wallet separately, we also offer a :doc:`combined executable
<../apps/CliFullWallet>` that perform both tasks simultaneously.

All API calls are formated in JSON and return JSON only. You can read more about
the API in the separated :doc:`API documentation <../api/index>`.
