********************************
Exchanges, Bridges, and Gateways
********************************

We here illustrate the steps necessary to securely operate as exchange or
gateway. Gateways take Fiat and convert them to their corresponding bitAsset at
a fee and vice versa. For instance:

 1. A customer requests 100 bitUSD from a gateway
 2. The gateway sends an invoice with bank account details
 3. When the funds arrive at the gateway a percentage is taken as a fee and the
    rest is transfered as bitUSD directly into the BitShares wallet of the
    customer.

For exchanges we recommend to also read :doc:`../what-is-different` and
:doc:`../often-used-calls`.
