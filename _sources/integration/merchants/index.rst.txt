We here illustrate the steps necessary to securely operate as merchant.
Merchants take funds from customers on the blockchain and deliver a good. Hence,
a merchant should monitor the blockchain and be notified on incoming
transactions. Thanks to (encrypted) transaction memos attachable to each
transfer the merchant can easily distinguish different customers.

For exchanges we recommend to also read :doc:`../what-is-different` and
:doc:`../often-used-calls`.
