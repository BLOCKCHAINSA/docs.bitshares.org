Account White-/Black-Lists
**************************

In order to be able to use white- and black-lists on your account, you are
required to be a lifetime member (October '15). This requirement is defined by the
shareholders and may change any time.

While, in general, an account's white-/black-list serves no direct function
besides casting an opinion, we can link this ability with an asset in such that
an asset can have one (or multiple) list authorities. These authorities are
accounts with black-/white-lists that are used to define the asset's lists
instead.

Use Case
########

A potiential use case could be to offer an independent KYC/AML service for
exchanges that want to outsource identity verification. Let's assume an exchange
``E`` outsources identity verification of German users to the german company
``Gv`` and for US. citizens to company ``Uv``. Both verification companies can
be defined as authorities for ``E``'s asset(s). Whenever a US citizen
successfully verifies at ``Uv``, he gets added to ``Uv``'s account white-list
and is automatically authorized to trade any asset that uses ``Uv`` for there
verifications (including ``E``).

.. _whitelist_accounts:

Example
#######

A user can be added to ``<accountname>``'s white-list via ::

    whitelist_accont <accountname> <white_account> white_listed true

In contrast, a user can be removed from ``<accountname>``'s white-list via ::

   whitelist_accont <accountname> <white_account> no_listing true

... or put on the black-list:::

   whitelist_accont <accountname> <white_account> black_listed true
