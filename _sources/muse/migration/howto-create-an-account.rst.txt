Creating a MUSE account
***************************

In order to use MUSE, you will need to register an account. All you need
to provide is

* an account name and
* a password to protect your (default) wallet.

The identicon at the top can be used to verify your account name to third
parties. It is derived from your acocunt name and gives a second verification
factor. And this is how you register your account:

        :width: 500px
        :align: center

Note that, in contrast to any other platform you have ever used:
Your account name can be seen similar to a mail address in such that it
is **unique** and every participant in the MUSE network can interact
with you independent of the actual partner providing the wallet.
