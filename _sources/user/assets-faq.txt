What about Parent and Child assets?
***********************************

A **parent**/**child** relation ship for assets can be represented by
the name of the symbol, e.g.::

    PARENT.child

can only be created by the issuer of ``PARENT`` and no one else.

Market Fees?
************

If *Market Fees* of a UIA are turned on, fees have to be payed for each
market transaction (buy, sell, bid, fill, etc ...). If the asset's fee
pool is funded, the fees can payed in the native IUA instead of BTS.

The percentage of market fees that are applied can be defined and
changed by the issuer.

If the Market Fee is set to 1%, the issuer will earn 1% of market volume
as profit. These profits are accumulated for each UIA and can be
withdrawn by the issuer. 

What are Asset Flags and Permissions?
*************************************

When an asset is creatd, the issuer can set any combination of
flags/permissions. **Flags** are set in stone unless there is
**permission** to edit. Once a permission to edit is revoked, flags are
permanent, and can never be modified again.
