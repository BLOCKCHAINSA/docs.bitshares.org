Voting
******

If you hold some ``BTS`` tokens, you are considered a shareholder of the
BitShares business and thus have a say in where it should be heading in
future. As a shareholder you can cast a vote for three different
entities within the network:

* **Block producers** bundle transactions into blocks and sign them with
  their signing key. These so called *witnesses* keep the blockchain alive by producing one
  block every few seconds and get paid by newly issued BTS shares
  similar to Bitcoin. Their second job is to produce reliable and
  accurate price feeds for the smartcoins.
* **Committee Members** :doc:`govern the blockchain and the business
  parameters <governance>`, and define the transaction fees.
* **Workers** are freelancers or businesses that provide a
  non-profitable service for the BitShares ecosystem. Essentially, they
  apply for a job in the ecosystem by providing actual work and get paid
  accordingly (if the shareholders approve).

Since voting might be a too time-consuming task for many shareholders,
BitShares offers them a way to delegate their voting power to so called
**proxies**. The sole purpose of proxies is to follow the ecosystem and
be vote according to their *followers*. This is similar to many
political votes where citizens vote for representatives which vote on
their behalf.

Voting itself is **very simply** with the User interface and requires
only a few clicks which are described in the :doc:`voting tutorials
<../tutorials/voting>`

.. note:: The proxy ``xeroc`` is owned by the author of the
          documentation articles you are currently reading and has a
          `discussion thread avaiable
          <https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,20792.0.html>`_.
