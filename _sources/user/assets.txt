Assets/Tokens
*************

The BitShares 2.0 network consist of several *assets*, *tokens* or *currencies*.
All assets are equal from a technological point of view and come with more or
less the same features, namely, they can be traded against each other and can be
transfered within seconds. The differences between them are of economical
nature.

User Issued Assets (UIAs)
############################################

Freely traded tokens created by individuals used for a variety of use-cases.
Often UIAs are used as IOUs issued by a bank, exchange or other financial
institute to represent deposit receipts.

Market-Pegged Assets (MPA)

These *SmartCoins* track the value of an underlaying asset, such as Gold, or
U.S. Dollar. Smartcoins can be created by anyone contracting with the
BitShares ecosystem and putting sufficient BTS (at least 175%) into the so
called contract for difference as *collateral*.

to take and participants can settle at this price.
