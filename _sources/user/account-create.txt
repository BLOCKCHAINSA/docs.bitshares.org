Account Registration
********************

In order to use BitShares, you will need to register an account.  All you need
to provide is

* an account name
* a password

For regular users, please follow the instructions in the wallet to create a new
account:

.. include:: /bitshares/register-ref.rst

The identicon at the top cn be used to verify your account name to third
parties. It is derived from your acocunt name and gives a second verification
factor. And this is how you register your account:

.. image:: create-account.png
        :alt: Create new account
        :width: 350px
        :align: center

Note that, in contrast to any other platform you have ever used:
**Creating an account at one of our partners will make your account available at
all the other partners as well.**
Hence, your account name can be seen similar to a mail address in such that it
is **unique** and every participant in the BitShares network can interact with
you independent of the actual partner providing the wallet.

We also provide a :doc:`tutorial <../tutorials/account-create>` on how to
**manually** register an account using the :doc:`CLI wallet
<../../integration/apps/cliwallet>`.
