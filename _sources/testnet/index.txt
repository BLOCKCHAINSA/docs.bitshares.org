We produdly present the first `public testnet`_ based on graphene and
took the opportunity to construct a tutorial from the process.

How it has been deployed
########################

We took the opportunity to write the process of customizing and
deploying a graphene blockchain as well as the faucet, web wallet and
feed scripts into a tutorial for everyone to use.
