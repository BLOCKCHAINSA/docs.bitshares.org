*********************
Genesis Configuration
*********************

We will create a genesis file named ``my-genesis.json`` that contains
the genesis block:

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir -p genesis
   programs/witness_node/witness_node --create-genesis-json genesis/my-genesis.json
   vim genesis/my-genesis.json

The ``my-genesis.json`` is the initial state of the network.

Genesis editing
***************

If you want to customize the network's initial state, edit ``my-genesis.json``.
This allows you to control things such as:

- The accounts that exist at genesis, their names and public keys
- Assets and their initial distribution (including core asset)
- The initial values of chain parameters
- The account / signing keys of the ``init`` witnesses (or in fact any account at all).

The chain ID is a hash of the genesis state.  All transaction signatures
are only valid for a single chain ID.  So editing the genesis file will
change your chain ID, and make you unable to sync with all existing
chains (unless one of them has exactly the same genesis file you do).

Writing final genesis
#####################

We now copy our gensis template file over to the graphene root
directory:::

    $ cp genesis/my-genesis.json genesis.json
    $ vim genesis.json
    $ git add genesis.json
    $ git commit -m "Added genesis.json"

The **initial timestamp** needs to be pasted into ``genesis.json`` file
in the initial_timestamp field. Choose it relatively close to the future
where you can generate the genesis block (e.g. now plus 10 minutes).

Including Genesis into the binaries
###################################

To let the binaries know about your new genesis block, we need to
recompile it and provide ``cmake`` with the parameter to identify the
genesis block properly:

::
    $ make clean
    $ find . -name "CMakeCache.txt" | xargs rm -f
    $ find . -name "CMakeFiles" | xargs rm -Rf
    $ cmake -DGRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON="$(pwd)/genesis.json" .

You can add the ``GRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON`` to the default parameters by
adding:

::

    set(GRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/genesis.json" )

to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. This way, you don't need to provide this
parameter all the time.
