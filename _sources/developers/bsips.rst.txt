BitShares Improvement Proposal
******************************

BSIP stands for BitShares Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an
improvement *protocol*. A BSIP is a design document providing information to the
BitShares community, or describing a new feature for BitShares or its processes
or environment. The BSIP should provide a concise technical specification of the
feature or the idea and a rationale for it. It may not only describe technical
improvements but also document *best-practises* and recommendations.

We intend BSIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for
collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions
that have gone into BitShares. The BSIP author is responsible for building
consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the BSIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

A detailed description of the structure of BSIPs can be found in `BSIP-0001`_
