..  Since BitShares 0.9.3c, we have a Graphene compatible *Export Wallet*
  function that can be selected from the menu bar ands allows to easily
  export your current wallet. 
  .. note:: Version 0.9.3**c** is required for this step. Otherewise the backup
            will have the old, incompatible format!

Since BitShares 0.9.3c, we have a Graphene compatible *Export Wallet*
function that can be issued in the console
(`Account List->Advanced Settings->Console`)::

          wallet_export_keys C:/Users/[your user name]/AppData/Roaming/BitShares/keys.json

Please replace ``[your user name]`` with your Windows account name. If you
don't know your full path you can browse to ``%APPDATA%`` and copy&paste the
directory.

The resulting file ``keys.json`` will be located in your 

.. * **Windows**: ``%APPDATA%\Roaming\BitShares`` (Try going to Start->Run and opening %APPDATA%, then open the BitShares folder)
   * **Mac**: ``~/Library/Application Support/BitShares`` (Open a Finder window and press Command-Shift-G, then paste in the path)
   * **Linux**: ``~/.BitShares``

.. note:: The exported wallet file will be encrypted with your pass phrase! Make
          sure to remember it when trying to use that file again!

.. note:: Bitshares in Windows might need to be started as administrator, if
          you export to the c:/ drive directy, i.e. with ``wallet_export_keys c:\keys.json``
