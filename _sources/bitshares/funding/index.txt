Funding Your Ideas
******************

You have a great idea for a business on top of within the BitShares platform
and are searching for a way to fund your idea? Here are the options we can offer
you:

* **Basic Worker Proposal**:
  All BitShares shareholders can cast a vote for your proposal/idea and will
  decide if they want this feature or not at the price you are asking. If they
  accept the price you asked, you will be #paidbyprotocol in BTS. If not, you
  can of course refine your proposal and try again incorporating feedback
  received from shareholders and the community.
* **Fee Backed Asset**:
  If you produce a feature for BitShares that offers a new service, you can have
  a :doc:`Fee Backed Assset <../user/fba>` created for your feature and profit
  from future revenue streams generated by that particular feature.
* **Crowdfunding**:
  Instead of profiting from your FBA, you can sell them to investors to fund
  the implementation. Or you simply create, issue and sell a :doc:`../user/uia`.
* **Mixed Funding**:
  You sell some of the FBA and keep the rest for yourself. Maybe the best
  option, you get money instantly to fund the development and you will get a lot
  more later when people use the feature.

You will probably have to cooperate with Cryptonomex with this. They can consult
you how to implement everything on the blockchain, issue FBA, etc. At least they
have to check the code before it is implemented to the blockchain so that
shareholders can be sure it is high quality.

Other options are basic GUI stuff, development, etc. You can either be a
contractor to Cryptonomex or make your own worker proposal.

If you have any other features on mind that require new kind of transaction on
the blockchain, you can code that feature and fund it with an FBA.
