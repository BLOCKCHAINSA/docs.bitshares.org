BitShares 2.0
*************

BitShares is a technology supported by next generation entrepreneurs, investors, and
developers with a common interest in finding free market solutions by leveraging the power
of globally decentralized consensus and decision making. Consensus technology has the
power to do for economics what the internet did for information. It can harness the
combined power of all humanity to coordinate the discovery and aggregation of real-time
knowledge, previously unobtainable. This knowledge can be used to more effectively
coordinate the allocation of resources toward their most productive and valuable use.
