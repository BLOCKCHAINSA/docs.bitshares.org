Confidential Transactions
*************************

A confidential transfer is one that hides the amount being sent. Confidential
transfers are also referred to as blinded transfers. It makes use of Oleg
Andreev's `blind signatures`_.

When privacy is important no account is ever used twice and it is impossible for
any third party to identify how money is moving through blockchain analysis
alone.

.. note:: Confindential transactions are currently only available using the
   :doc:`cli-wallet <../../integration/apps/cliwallet>`. A step-by-step guide
   can be found in the :doc:`tutorials <../tutorials/confidential-transactions>`
