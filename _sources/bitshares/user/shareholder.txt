In contrast to most crypto-currencies, BitShares does not claim to be a
currency but rather an *equity* in a decentral autonomous company (DAC).
As a result, the market valuation of BitShares is free floating and may be as
volatile as any other equity (e.g. of traditional companies).

Every entity hold the core token (BTS) is considered a shareholder of the
BitShares decentralized company.

Nonetheless, BTS tokens can be used as *collateral* in financial smart contracts
such as market pegged assets and thus back every existing smartcoin such as the
bitUSD.

Furthermore, each BTS can be used to cast a vote for

* :doc:`Block Producers <witness>`
* :doc:`Commmittee members <committee>`

and can thus participate in the corporate governance.
