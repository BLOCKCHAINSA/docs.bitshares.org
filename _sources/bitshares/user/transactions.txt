Transactions and Operations
***************************

BitShares 2.0 implements a variety of operations besides simple transfers of
funds. For instance in order to operate the :doc:`decentralized exchange
<dex>` we need support for buy, sell orders as well. The technical
documentation about all operation types can be found in our `doxygen docs`_.
