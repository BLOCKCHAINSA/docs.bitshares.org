Assets/Tokens
*************

The BitShares 2.0 network consist of several *assets*, *tokens* or *currencies*.
All of them can be grouped into three *types of assets*:

* **User Issued Assets (UIAs)**:
  Freely traded tokens created by individuals used for a variety of use-cases.
  Often UIAs are used as IOUs issued by a bank, exchange or other financial
  institute to represent deposit receipts. :doc:`Read more <uia>`.

* **Market-Pegged Assets (MPA)**:
  These *SmartCoins* track the value of an underlaying asset, such as Gold, or
  U.S. Dollar. Smartcoins can be created by anyone contracting with the
  BitShares ecosystem and putting sufficient BTS (at least 175%) into the so
  called contract for difference as *collateral*. :doc:`Read more <mpa>`.

* **Privatized Bit-Assets**:
  A flexible mixture between UIA and MPA that allows 3rd parties to create their
  own customized MPAs. :doc:`Read more <privbta>`.

* **Fee Backed Assets**:
  An FBA is a token that pays you a fraction of the transaction fees generated
  by a particular feature that has been funded independent of BitShares.
  :doc:`Read more <fba>`.

All assets are equal from a technological point of view and come with more or
less the same features, namely, they can be traded against each other and can be
transfered within seconds. The differences between them are of economical
nature.
