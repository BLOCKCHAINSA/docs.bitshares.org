Creating a UIA

How are transfer fees treated?
******************************

From what I've seen, if you turn on Market Fee you pay fees in your UIA. If
it's Off, you pay fees in BTS.

Note that you control the fee price with the ratio set between your UIA:BTS in
QUOTE ASSET and BASE AMOUNT.

So for 1 UIA = 1 BTS you set both to 1 which means you will pay the same amount
in your UIA for fees as you would if you turned off Market Fee and payed fees in
BTS. "same" being if it's 30 BTS you pay 30 UIA.

I "think" if you set Market Fee % to 50% you will earn 50% of market fees back
to your account. I'm hoping someone will correct me if that's wrong. I have
heard from tonyk that if you set to 100% it makes your UIA stealth but I cannot
confirm this and in my testing that did not appear to be the case, but again I
have no idea and am hoping for some documentation one day. ;)

I have no clue what Max Market Fee does, but I set mine to 100,000 always simply
because I saw Dan set Brownie.PTS to some really high number. ;)

What is the meaning of each flag?
*********************************

FLAGS:

1. Enable market fee. why there are 2 lines what does it mean?
2. Require holders to be white-listed?
3. Issuer may transfer asset back to himself? Does this mean I can take back the tokens who others may have paid in the future to buy in the open market? what...???
4. Issuer must approve all transfers? I guess this mean people can't trade and only I can make the transfers?
5. Disable confidential transactions?

PERMISSIONS:
Same questions as above. What does these mean. What is the difference. Which ones I turn on or disable..??

C) Sharebits.io

I am not sure exactly what this does. I do apologize there is no excuse to that.
Please explain if possible in 2 lines.  Can I use sharebits to distribute my
coin to all forum members, to bitcoin talk members, reddit members etc?

D) Is there a way for me to distribute my token to forum members automatically
or do I need to make one by one the transfers my self?

E) Ideally I would like people who visit www.bitshares.gr and register in an
online wallet to receive x amount automatically from my token. Is there an easy
automated way I can do this or do I need to check every time who registered via
the website and do it my self manually.

F) Once eventually I manage hopefully to create my UIA, How do I list this in
the market? What do I do if I want my token to be traded vs. BTS for example?

G) Anything else I should know about this?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! :)
