Accounts
========

BitShares 2.0 accounts have to be registered on the blockchain. Upon
registration they are assigned an incrementing identifier (account id).

Thanks to separating *authorities* from *identities*, BitShares 2.0 can be much
faster in processing delay while having much smaller transaction sizes. Hence,
all participants are forced to have a named account on the blockchain.
Furthermore, most transactions are tied to an account name and can thus be
linked to individuals (this includes transferes, trades, shorts, etc. but not
*stealthed* transactions).

.. note:: Even though an account is required to be registered properly, we offer
   tools to improve privacy and anonymity.

.. FIXME more text, json structur of account etc.
