Thank you, Fabian, for your detailed explanations!

One more question please:
In my dashboard I see the following 2 BTC lines:

ASSET                                 EQUIVALENT VALUE                  MARKET
0,00001693 BTC                             1,67475 BTS                  BTC : BTS
0,4993378   TRADE.BTC   38.428,83123 BTS                    TRADE.BTC : BTS

Is there any way to get this two assets together?

My motivation: I need to understand the system completely, before I invest in Gold and Silver.

--------------
technically those are two different assets. Even though they both relate to the Bitcoin and its price, they achieve this by different means.

TRADE.BTC and OPENBTC are IOUs (I owe you) given out by OpenLedger and Blocktrades and can be used to redeem "real" BTC from them.

BTC is a market pegged asset issued by the BitShares network by means of a Contract for Difference. Hence, someone has put collateral into a CFD. You cand find details about it here: http://docs.bitshares.eu/bitshares/papers/

So, in order to 'combine' them into a single position/asset .. you can either trade
BTC->TRADE.BTC
or TRADE.BTC->BTC
I hope that these markets will become more and more liquid over time.
