Profiting from BTS

Plot twist: what will happen if we allowed people to trade MSHARES directly instead of handing them out to makers?
Think of
* BTS for shareholders of the super DAC
* OBITs for shareholders of a partner business
* FEATUREUIA for shareholders of a business unit
* MSHARES for shareholders of a particular market

thinking about it .. MSHARES feel like artistcoins for a market (a pair of TWO assets)

Funding projects within BitShares:
(https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,20205.msg266857.html#msg266857)

You could produce a feature for Bitshares that includes ZKT + Zerocash mixer and GUI. You can fund this with:
- Basic worker proposal. BTS shareholders will decide by voting if they want this feature or not, and if they accept the price you ask.
- Fee Backed Asset. You produce the feature and issue an FBA for it that will bring revenue for you when the feature is used. Here are some calculations how to value it.
- Crowdfunding. You will issue an FBA, sell it and use those funds for development.
- Mixed funding. You sell some of the FBA and keep the rest for yourself. Maybe the best option, you get money instantly to fund the development and you will get a lot more later when people use the feature.

You will propably have to cooperate with Cryptonomex with this. They can consult you how to implement everything on the blockchain, issue FBA, etc. At least they have to check the code before it is implemented to the blockchain so that shareholders can be sure it is high quality.

Other options are basic GUI stuff, development, etc. You can either be a contractor to Cryptonomex or make your own worker proposal (like svk just did)

If you have any other features on mind that require new kind of transaction on the blockchain, you can code that feature and fund it with an FBA.

Anyway, my personal take on anonymous/private transfers is that of course we should implement best option available. Stealth transfers that we now have is good, but not the best. Having the best one is huge marketing advantage for Bitshares.
