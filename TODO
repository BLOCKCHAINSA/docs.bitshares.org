Profiting from BTS

Plot twist: what will happen if we allowed people to trade MSHARES directly instead of handing them out to makers?
Think of
* BTS for shareholders of the super DAC
* OBITs for shareholders of a partner business
* FEATUREUIA for shareholders of a business unit
* MSHARES for shareholders of a particular market

thinking about it .. MSHARES feel like artistcoins for a market (a pair of TWO assets)
